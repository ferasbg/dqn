# dqn-agents
Implementations of dqn-based rl agents for 2D arcade games.


## Components
### `/2048`  
    - `/2048/agent`: stored DQN agent
    - `/2048/env`: 2048 game environment


## Future Work
Some core challenges in DQN is the implicit design decisions for building agents within sandbox and 3D first-person shooter games, that requires accounting for interactions of all the possible event instances and state, action, and reward sets in more complex, random, and nuanced virtual game environments, but accounting for prioritization and networked reasoning with respect to rewards that are loosely defined to start with in such types of games.
